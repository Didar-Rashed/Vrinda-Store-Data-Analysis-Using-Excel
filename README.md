***
## Introduction
This analysis focuses on the sales and customer behavior of Vrinda Store for the year 2022. The primary aim is to address key business questions regarding sales trends, customer demographics, and product performance to support decision-making.

## Objective ðŸŽ¯
The analysis seeks to answer the following questions:
+ Compare the sales and orders using a single chart.
+ Identify the month with the highest sales and orders.
+ Determine whether men or women purchased more in 2022.
+ List the different order statuses in 2022.
+ Identify the top 5 states contributing to sales.
+ Explore the relation between age and gender based on the number of orders.
+ Identify the channel contributing to the maximum sales.
+ Determine the highest selling product category.

## Data Preparation
Before diving into the analysis, I observed the raw dataset and identified areas for improvement. To ensure the data was ready for analysis:
+ __Extra Columns:__ I added additional columns to streamline the analysis, such as:
    
    + __Order Month:__ Extracting the month from order dates to analyze seasonal trends.
    + __Customer Segment:__ Derived customer demographics for more detailed segmentation (e.g., Age Groups, Gender).

These enhancements allowed for more granular insights in the dashboard.

## Pivot Tables
To answer the business questions effectively, I created several pivot tables:
+ __Monthly Sales and Orders:__ This pivot table displays the sum of total sales and count of orders per month, offering insights into sales trends and peak order periods.

+ __Sales by Gender:__ A breakdown of sales by gender to highlight customer demographics.

+ __Top 5 States:__ Displays the top 5 states based on total sales, helping to understand regional performance.

+ __Order Status Overview:__ Shows the frequency of each order status, providing insights into operational efficiency.
Pivot tables allowed me to slice the data from multiple perspectives and made it easier to create charts that provide a visual narrative.

## Dashboard Visualizations
After creating the pivot tables, I visualized the insights using different charts to create an interactive dashboard. Key visualizations include:
+ __Sales vs. Orders Line Chart:__ This chart compares monthly sales and orders over the year, highlighting seasonal patterns. For example, March shows a peak in both orders and sales, indicating high demand during that time.

+ __Gender-Based Sales Pie Chart:__ A pie chart visualizes the proportion of sales contributed by men and women, making it easy to identify which gender drove the most sales in 2022.

+ __Top 5 States Bar Chart:__ This bar chart highlights the performance of the top 5 states in terms of sales. It's clear which states are the strongest contributors to the storeâ€™s revenue.

+ __Order Status Breakdown:__ A stacked bar chart or pie chart that shows the distribution of different order statuses (e.g., Completed, Canceled, Pending), helping to monitor fulfillment rates and identify potential operational bottlenecks.

+ __Sales by Channel:__ A bar or donut chart represents sales by channel (e.g., online vs. in-store), offering a clear view of which sales channels are most effective.

+ __Age Group and Gender Analysis:__ A bubble chart or heatmap showing the relationship between age groups and gender, which helps identify which demographics make the most purchases.


## Insights from the Dashboard

+ __Monthly Trends:__ The line chart reveals the month with the highest sales and order volume. This can guide inventory planning and promotional strategies for future periods.

+ __Customer Segmentation:__ The gender-based sales chart suggests whether men or women are more significant contributors to revenue, offering a basis for targeted marketing strategies.

+ __Geographic Focus:__ The bar chart for top-performing states provides actionable insights on where to focus regional campaigns or expand further.

+ __Operational Efficiency:__ The order status chart uncovers fulfillment issues. High percentages of canceled or pending orders can point to logistical challenges that need to be addressed.

+ __Channel Effectiveness:__ By visualizing sales by channel, the store can invest more in the channels that are performing well and reassess underperforming ones.


## Conclusion
Through careful preparation of the dataset, creation of pivot tables, and the development of an interactive dashboard, Iâ€™ve gained key insights into Vrinda Storeâ€™s sales and operations. The dashboard serves as a tool for strategic decision-making, revealing trends, identifying areas for improvement, and providing data-driven recommendations to drive growth.
